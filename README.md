# Testing

In this project we use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/). 
To use, first ensure that it is installed and then run `pytest -v`
from the top-level directory.

We also use the [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) plugin to measure code coverage.
To use, run `pytest --cov src/ test/` from the top-level directory.
